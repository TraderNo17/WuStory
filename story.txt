I am at Gordon Avenue Market. I am at this place to have a dinner. First, I find no food awesome to eat. So I drink much water.
Today's waether is not good. I feel so sad. 

I drink the water to get rid of my sadness. My liver will handle what my heart cant. I wish I had some good awesome food to eat.
Suddenly a hamburger appears in front of me and I lunge at it. I hear a man and scream and turn around suddenly. The hamburger was the mans ear..

The man got really mad and yelled at me. I got scared and ran away. I went looking for good food to eat.
I used my phone to look for some good Chinese food. My phone told me there was a good
Chinese restaurant near me so I went in that direction.
