I am at Gordon Avenue Market. I am at this place to have a dinner. First, I find no food awesome to eat. So I drink much water.
Today's waether is not good. I feel so sad. 

I drink the water to get rid of my sadness. My liver will handle what my heart cant. I wish I had some good awesome food to eat.
Suddenly a hamburger appears in front of me and I lunge at it. I hear a man and scream and turn around suddenly. The hamburger was the mans ear..
